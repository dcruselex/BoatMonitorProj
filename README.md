# boatmonitoring
This project is to monitor a few of my houseboat evironment and critical systems. I will later expand to monitor additional systems.
The objective is to monitor remotely even during the winter season when less time is spent on the boat.

Initially, I will setup monitoring of temperature and water at limited locations on the boat, then expand to monitor additional locations as well as system and evnironmental conditions.

I will use a Raspberry Pi and other electronics to create the solution in addition to the Python code.
In additon, I will use an older tablet and small keyboard as the interface which I will locate in the houseboat controls area.    Remotely, it will be via a secure website.

This project will include using Raspberry Pi 3, breadboard, etc..

This will include initially power, voltage, water and temperature

Will add..d.d.d.d
