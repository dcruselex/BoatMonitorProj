Boatmonitoring

This project in Phase I is being done to satisfy requirements in a Python class as a capstone project.   In Phase I the project will be focused on meeting the class requirements while demonstrating understanding of specific python areas and providing a program that can be run in other environments without specialty hardware.    In Phase II for my personal goals it will utilize specific Raspberry Pi hardware, sensors, enclosure, etc..     The objective of Phase II will be to monitor several environmental and equipment statuses in my houseboat and report exceptions via alerts and WiFi to remote locations.   I eventually will monitor shore power status, voltage for both AC and DC voltages, water status in multiple compartments, humidity, temperature in multiple locations and will continue to add other sensors to monitor additional environmental and equipment status/metrics and alert on exceptions.

Phase I:

1.	Requirement for this README file that explains:
1.1	a brief description of what the project is about.
1.2	Which 3+ features I have included from the requirements list to meet the requirements.
1.3	Any special instruction required for the reviewer and testers to run the project.

2.	The 3+ features I have included from the requirements list to meet the requirements:
2.1 Implemented a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter command/perform actions, including to exit the program.
	Note:  In the program when running, after running, you will have options to (E) Exit, (S) Scan,  xxxxxx fill this out   
2.2 Created a class, then created at least one object of that class and populated it with data.   The value of at least object must be used somewhere in your code.
#	Note:  Used in files XXXX, XXXX and online XXXX in file XXXX
2.3 Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
	Note:  Built a conversion tool to a) convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius based on the current mode and another one that converts b) (E) English to (M) Metric via a switch. 
# 2.4.  Which requirement?
#	Note:  Printed the current date and time before each scan.
2.5    Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file.
#	Note:  Wrote a log file and entered invalid user choices from the main menu.

3.	The following are the specific and special instructions required for the reviewed and testers to run the program.

3.1 The user will need to run the program using Python3.
	Note:  Before running program you will need to "pip install termcolor"
    Note:  > python3 boatmon.py
